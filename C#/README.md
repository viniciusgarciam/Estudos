# üß† C# Beginner Console Projects

Welcome to the **C# Beginner Console Projects** repository! This collection comprises 15 console-based applications developed during the initial stages of learning C#. Each project focuses on fundamental programming concepts, providing hands-on experience with variables, conditionals, loops, and user input handling.

## üìö Projects Overview

1. **Password Verification**
   - Prompts the user to enter a password and verifies it against a predefined value.
   - Concepts: `if` statements, string comparison.

2. **Access Control**
   - Simulates an access system where the user must input the correct code to gain access.
   - Concepts: `if-else` statements, user input.

3. **School Attendance and Grading System**
   - Calculates whether a student passes based on attendance and average grades.
   - Concepts: arithmetic operations, nested `if` statements.

4. **Basic Calculator**
   - Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operations on two numbers.
   - Concepts: arithmetic operations, user input.

5. **Voting System**
   - Allows users to cast votes for candidates, null, or blank, and validates the input.
   - Concepts: `if-else` statements, input validation.

6. **Predecessor and Successor Finder**
   - Displays the predecessor and successor of a given number.
   - Concepts: arithmetic operations.

7. **Fishing Regulation Checker**
   - Determines if a fish's weight exceeds the legal limit and calculates the fine if necessary.
   - Concepts: constants, `if-else` statements.

8. **Fuel Price Calculator**
   - Calculates the final price after applying discounts based on fuel type and quantity.
   - Concepts: constants, `if-else` statements, arithmetic operations.

9. **Maximum Number Finder**
   - Accepts ten numbers from the user and identifies the largest one.
   - Concepts: loops (`for`), comparison operations.

10. **Multiplication Table Generator**
    - Generates a multiplication table for a given number using `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.
    - Concepts: loops, user input.

11. **Prize Distribution Calculator**
    - Distributes a prize among three friends based on their individual contributions.
    - Concepts: arithmetic operations, percentage calculations.

12. **Repeat Request Loop**
    - Continuously prompts the user to continue or stop using different loop structures.
    - Concepts: loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`), user input.

13. **Sum of Ten Numbers**
    - Calculates the sum of ten numbers entered by the user.
    - Concepts: loops, accumulation.

14. **Tinder Match Evaluation**
    - Simulates a matching system based on user attributes like age, height, weight, and hair color.
    - Concepts: multiple condition checks, `if` statements.

15. **Password Program**
    - Similar to the first project but reinforces understanding of conditionals and user input.
    - Concepts: `if-else` statements, string comparison.
