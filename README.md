### 📘 [Golang](./Go%20Developer)

Projects and scripts developed during my deeper learning in the Go language.

**Included Projects:**

- 🧾 Client API with `mux` and external JSON consumption
- 🧮 Calculator with variadic parameters
- 🌡️ Temperature conversion (Kelvin → Celsius)
- 🎯 "Pin and Pan" game with divisibility
- 🔢 Printing multiples of 3
- 🏓 Ping Pong with Goroutines and channels
- 🔁 Reinforcement in function structure with a new calculator

> This module demonstrates growing mastery in the language, including concepts like concurrency, HTTP routing, and code structuring.
